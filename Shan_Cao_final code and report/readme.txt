Seg.m
Segmented the target digits area

slidinggH.m
Horizontally sliding through the image, and give out the result of this number  

Lenet.m
Predict the what number it is, and give out the 3 outputs, valide,value,score

Test_32_32_data
Test the slidingH.m on the SVHN gound truth data

Compare.m
Compare the data style from SVHN, Mnist, and Andrew Ngâ€™data 
Try to find out the reason why the final output has a huge error rate at the first try,, after I rotate the image, the result is very accurate.

Test_my_own.m
Test my own hand written digits to see test the accuracy of caffe

/test_Mnist_data/project.m
Test caffe on its own test data

/caffe_andrew/project.m
Test caffe on Hand written digits data from Stanford machine learning online course

Add_noise.m
Try to analysis the original test data which has been added different scale of Gaussian white  noise

normalize.m this is used for normalize the intensity of image proportionaly to 0:255
